### Create a New OIDC App in Okta

To create a new OIDC app on Okta:

1. Log in to your developer account, navigate to **Applications**, and click on **Add Application**.
3. Select **Single-Page App** and click **Next**. 
4. Give the application a name, change all instances of `localhost:8080` to `localhost:4200` and click **Done**.

Set your `issuer` and copy the `clientId` in to `src/app/app.module.ts`. 

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.okta.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

```ts
const oktaConfig = {
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{clientId}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback'
};
```
