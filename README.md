### Create a New OIDC App in Okta

Before you begin, youâ€™ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com) and run `okta register` to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run `okta login`. Then, run `okta apps create`. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Choose **Single-Page App** and press **Enter**.

Use `http://localhost:4200/callback` for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to `http://localhost:4200`.

Copy your `issuer` and copy the `clientId` in to `src/app/app.module.ts`. 

```ts
const oktaConfig = {
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{clientId}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback'
};
```
